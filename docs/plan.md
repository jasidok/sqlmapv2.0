# SQLMap Python 3.11+ Modernization Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a comprehensive strategy to modernize SQLMap from its current Python 2.6+ compatibility to require
Python 3.11 as the minimum version. The modernization will improve performance, security, and maintainability while
preserving all existing functionality.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Compatibility Layer Removal

### 1.1 Python Version Requirements

**Rationale**: Establishing Python 3.11+ as the minimum version allows us to leverage modern language features, improved
performance, and enhanced security. Python 3.11 provides significant performance improvements (10-60% faster than 3.10)
and includes features like exception groups, enhanced error locations, and improved typing support.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Update version check in `lib/utils/versioncheck.py` to enforce Python >=3.11
- Modify error messages to guide users to upgrade Python
- Update CI/CD workflows to test only Python 3.11+
- Remove all Python 2.x compatibility code paths

**Risk Mitigation**:

- Provide clear migration documentation
- Maintain a legacy branch for critical security fixes
- Announce deprecation timeline in advance

### 1.2 Future Imports Cleanup

**Rationale**: `from __future__ import` statements are no longer needed in Python 3.11+. Removing them simplifies the
codebase and eliminates potential confusion about which Python version features are being used.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Systematically remove all `from __future__ import` statements
- Test each file after removal to ensure functionality is preserved
- Update code style to use native Python 3.11+ patterns

**Dependencies**: Must be completed after Python version requirement is established

## Phase 2: Core Compatibility Layer Modernization

### 2.1 Compatibility Module Refactoring

**Rationale**: The `lib/core/compat.py` module contains numerous workarounds for Python 2/3 compatibility. With Python
3.11+ as the target, most of this code becomes unnecessary and can be replaced with standard library equivalents.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Audit all functions in `lib/core/compat.py`
- Replace `xrange` with native `range`
- Replace `buffer` with `memoryview`
- Remove custom `cmp` function and update call sites to use key functions
- Eliminate version-specific imports and conditions

**Benefits**:

- Reduced code complexity
- Better performance through native implementations
- Improved maintainability

### 2.2 String Handling Modernization

**Rationale**: Python 3.11+ has excellent string handling capabilities. Modernizing string operations will improve
performance and readability.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Replace `%` formatting with f-strings where appropriate
- Update `.format()` calls to f-strings for better performance
- Review all unicode/bytes operations for Python 3.11+ best practices
- Standardize string encoding/decoding patterns

**Performance Impact**: f-strings are significantly faster than other formatting methods

## Phase 3: Third-Party Library Modernization

### 3.1 Library Audit and Updates

**Rationale**: Many bundled third-party libraries contain Python 2/3 compatibility code that is no longer needed. Some
libraries may have newer versions or standard library replacements.

**Implementation Strategy**:

#### High Priority Libraries:

- **six**: Complete removal as it's no longer needed
- **beautifulsoup**: Update to latest version or replace with modern alternative
- **bottle**: Update to latest version for REST API functionality
- **chardet**: Evaluate replacement with standard library or newer version

#### Medium Priority Libraries:

- **colorama**: Update for better Windows terminal support
- **fcrypt**: Review for modern cryptographic standards
- **keepalive**: Evaluate necessity with modern urllib3

#### Low Priority Libraries:

- **termcolor**: Consider standard library alternatives
- **pydes**: Review for security and performance
- **identywaf**: Update for current WAF detection patterns

**Security Considerations**: All cryptographic libraries must be reviewed for current security standards

### 3.2 Standard Library Adoption

**Rationale**: Python 3.11+ includes many features that were previously only available through third-party libraries.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Replace custom implementations with standard library equivalents
- Evaluate `pathlib` for file system operations
- Consider `asyncio` for concurrent network operations
- Use `functools.lru_cache` for memoization

## Phase 4: Code Modernization and Feature Enhancement

### 4.1 Modern Python Features Integration

**Rationale**: Python 3.11+ introduces powerful features that can improve code quality, performance, and
maintainability.

#### Structural Pattern Matching

- **Use Case**: Complex conditional logic in SQL injection detection
- **Implementation**: Replace nested if/elif chains with match statements
- **Benefits**: More readable and potentially faster conditional logic

#### Exception Groups

- **Use Case**: Handling multiple errors in parallel operations
- **Implementation**: Use exception groups for batch operations and multi-threaded error handling
- **Benefits**: Better error reporting and debugging

#### Enhanced Error Locations

- **Use Case**: Debugging and error reporting
- **Implementation**: Leverage improved traceback information
- **Benefits**: Faster problem resolution

### 4.2 Type Safety Implementation

**Rationale**: Type hints improve code quality, catch errors early, and enhance IDE support.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Add type hints to public APIs first
- Gradually add type hints to critical internal functions
- Use `TypedDict` for configuration dictionaries
- Implement protocols for duck-typed interfaces

**Tools Integration**:

- Add mypy to CI/CD pipeline
- Configure strict type checking for new code
- Use pyright/pylance for IDE integration

### 4.3 Performance Optimizations

**Rationale**: Python 3.11+ offers significant performance improvements that we should leverage.

#### Caching Strategies

- **Use Case**: Expensive computations and database queries
- **Implementation**: `functools.lru_cache` and `functools.cached_property`
- **Benefits**: Reduced redundant operations

#### Data Structure Optimization

- **Use Case**: Core data structures and configuration objects
- **Implementation**: `dataclasses` with `__slots__` for memory efficiency
- **Benefits**: Lower memory usage and faster attribute access

#### Async Integration

- **Use Case**: Network operations and I/O-bound tasks
- **Implementation**: Evaluate `asyncio` for concurrent HTTP requests
- **Benefits**: Better resource utilization and response times

## Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance
